## Dangling objects in the repository

 Sometimes using git  you obtain this message in console
 
````
warning: The last gc run reported the following. Please correct the root cause
and remove .git/gc.log
Automatic cleanup will not be performed until the file is removed.

warning: There are too many unreachable loose objects; run 'git prune' to remove them.

````
This means you have too many dangling commits for git to automatically clean up.

- Dangling objects are issues for git to resolve:

- Dangling blob = A change that made it to the staging area/index, but never got committed. 

Dangling commit = A commit that isn't directly linked to by any child commit, branch, tag or other reference. 

You can delete or get them back.


### Verification of basic information about commits and dangling blobs.

```
git fsck
```

- If you gets this result you repo is perfect regarding some git checks:

```
Checking object directories: 100% (256/256), done.
Checking objects: 100% (16396/16396), done.
```
 

- If you gets something like this we must to work on that:

```
dangling blob 91ff5fc4ad27e73cd1937dfda304708d31660956
dangling commit 96ffeaa7caefcf649f5b864b516e7314b24cbe8c
Verifying commits in commit graph: 100% (2603/2603), done.
```
